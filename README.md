# Hy Django

This project is a sample of a project using 
[Hy](https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/) with
[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/).

It follows the [Django Getting
Started](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/) documentation, but uses
Hy for the entire project. Many of the generated parts were also replaced with
Hy.

## Initial Setup

``` shell
$ pip install django

# Newer version of python require the git version of hy.
$ pip insatll git+https://github.com/hylang/hy.git
```
